# Rotor Routing

Rotor routing is a deterministic version of the random walk that can be represented by the motion of particles along a simple digraph. Whenever a particle exits a node along a path (or rotor), the path points to a new head. In this ongoing research project, we have visualized rotor routing on Z^2 with a variety of initial configurations. We have also created parameters for the size and speed of the visualization, as well as the surface (e.g., torus, projective plane, Klein bottle, etc.) it is projected onto. From these results we hope to form various conjectures about rotor routing.
